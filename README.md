Project Title: Bubble Chat: Pop Your Messages

Project Overview:

Bubble Chat is a playful and interactive messaging app that transforms the way people communicate. Instead of sending plain text messages, users type their messages into virtual bubbles that float across the screen. The recipient must "pop" the bubble to read the message, adding an element of fun and suspense. Sometimes, bubbles may pop on their own due to random events, making the experience unpredictable and exciting.

The app combines the joy of popping bubbles with the thrill of messaging, creating a unique and engaging user experience. Itâ€™s perfect for users who want to add a touch of whimsy and interactivity to their conversations.

Key Features:

Floating Bubbles: Messages float and bounce around the screen.

Pop to Read: Tap to pop the bubble and reveal the message.

Random Pop: Bubbles can pop unexpectedly, losing the message.

Customization: Choose bubble colors, sizes, and patterns.

Real-Time Tracking: Watch bubbles float across the screen.

Sound Effects: Fun popping sounds and bubble noises.
